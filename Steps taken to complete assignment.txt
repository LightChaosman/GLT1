We started out by installing the required software, following the installation guide.

Next we followed the dsl modelling tutorial step-by-step (Even before reading the assignment).

After reading the assignment we tried to infer the metamodel behind the image of the Platoon language, and made a first attempt to create the corrosponding Ecore model.

This had some inheritence flaws, which were quickly flushed out.

A problem that took a bit longer to solve was making sure that after we generated the plug in, that we would be able to create the 3 desired objects.
It turned out to be the flag 'containment' that was causing these flaws. (which we had set to false instead of true)

After making sure that the models we could create using the plug ins allowed all desired behaviour, and nothing more, we continued.

From both projects' genmodel file we generated Xtext projects.
These projects ran out of the box, and allowed the desired models to be expressed.
However, not in the syntax displayed in the assignment.

When altering the grammar of the platoon language we stumpled upon the problem of not having IDs for vehicles and routes.
We adapted the ecore model and regenerated the xtext project.

With the IDs in place, the conversion to the desired syntax was quitte straightforward.
